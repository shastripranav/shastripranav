# Pranav Shastri

**VP of Technology & AI** at MPS Interactive | Enterprise AI Architect | Independent Tech Consultant

I build the AI systems I lead teams to deliver. From multi-agent architectures using Microsoft Copilot Studio and LangChain, to voice AI integrations with ElevenLabs, to full-stack platforms on AWS and Azure — I architect it, ship it, and then lead the team that scales it for Fortune 500 clients.

15 years across enterprise AI, product engineering, and technical leadership. Currently leading a 40+ person cross-functional technology team driving $1M+ in annual project value. Previously built and scaled platforms supporting 2,000+ professionals annually across 50+ parallel programs at MThree (Wiley Edge) for clients including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, State Street, HSBC, and Standard Chartered.
